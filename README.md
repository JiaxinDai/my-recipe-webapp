# Recipe Sharing Webapp

A full stack social recipe sharing app that allows end-users to share and discuss their home-recipes and encourage food creations. These days the concept of sharing is very popular both in real life and in digital society. This web application seeks to build upon the core idea that users like sharing their food by providing a platform that allows users to post pictures of the food they are eating along with a recipe describing how to make it, similar to what we have seen in many other popular social networking platforms such as Instagram and Facebook.
